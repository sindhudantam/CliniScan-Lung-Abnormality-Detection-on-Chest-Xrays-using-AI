# CliniScan-Lung-Abnormality-Detection-on-Chest-Xrays-using-AI
This project aims to develop an AI-based system to detect and localize lung abnormalities in chest X-ray images using deep learning. Trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset, it identifies pathologies such as opacities, fibrosis, and masses, assisting radiologists with accurate, interpretable, and clinically relevant diagnostic support.
